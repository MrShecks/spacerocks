# spacerocks
Spacerocks is a simple PyGame space shooter game where the player gets to blow up lots of rocks!

The project was originally written using the CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org/) web based Python development tool as the final project of Rice University's - Introduction To Interactive Programming In Python MOOC course I completed in 2014.

Original Game:

My goal is to port (or re-write) the project as a stand-alone game using the PyGame library as an exercise in Python programming (I really need a refresher) and to learn a bit more about PyGame.

I might also add some new elements to the game (Moar weapons!!) and try to improve the game play (it's far too easy so different difficulty levels would be nice).


Shecks.
